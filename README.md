The project consits of 2 problems:

1. To write a function that flattens a given list.The elements of this list can also include lists. 
  Example input: [[1, 'a', ['cat'], 2], [[[3]], 'dog'], 4, 5]
  Example output: [1, 'a', 'cat', 2, 3, 'dog' ,4 ,5]

2. To write a function that reverses the elemets of a given list. The elements of this list can again include lists. In that case, elements of these lists are also to be reversed.
  Example input: [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6,7]]
  Example output: [[7,6,5],[4,3],[2,1]]
